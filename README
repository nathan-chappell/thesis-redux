Note: main is intended to run on call graph files made from running get_call_graph in a directory with a compilation database.

In order to get a simple (somewhat interactive) call graph of main:
	make
	./main main.call_graph

Of an arbitrary compilation database:
	./get_call_graph [directory] > filename //current directory is default
	./main filename

To get the compilation database, I run:
	bear make [whatever] -B
